        <h3>ELEANOR SIM</h3>

        <p>Hello! </p>

        <p>I'm Eleanor. I like travelling, watching musicals and making cool stuff. In my free time, I like writing code to automate simple tasks or enhance
        particular experiences. I love learning about and working with new tech, and am incredibly excited about all the positive applications of technology
        that can make our world a better place.</p>

        <p>I'm currently pursuing a Computer Science degree at Georgia Tech, with concentrations in Intelligence and Information Internetworks. I have some experience with web and Android app development, as well as with simple machine learning.</p>

        <p>This site was made (a while ago) to learn basic HTML. For now, it's just a wrapper for my projects, but I hope to enhance its aesthetic when I get better at web development.</p>
