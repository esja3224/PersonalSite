        <p>If you're here, you're one of the following: <ol>
            <li>Eleanor</li>
            <li>A stalker</li>
            <li>Google PageRank?</li>
        </ol>
        Thus, you either know everything going on here or should not know anything. If, by chance, you happen to be someone I personally sent this link to, be honored! This site was created for me to practice Web Development but I hope it'll become a product - either a personal portfolio or a page containing cool stuff - I'm proud of and will constantly update!
